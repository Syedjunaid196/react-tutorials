    <!-- why two files of react 
    first file: this is the core of the react "core react algorithm written in it." -->

    <!--  second link is the : react-dom: this is the react library which is used for dom operations or 
    to modify the dom (document object model) -->

    <!-- now how to create h1 tag using react -->
    <!-- for that we need to add script tag and in that we use react.createElement() and it uses three 
      arguments 
      1)which tag
      2)an object -- where we can give attributes to the tags..
      3) what to put  in that tag 

      and after that we have to put that element into the root tag which is in the html to show in the browser 
      for that we 've to create a root in the react and for that:
      we use ReactDOM.createRoot() and put the argument ;

      and now to put that element into the root we use root.render() and pass the element as an argument
      here is how we do that-->

    <script src="./App.js">

        //the order of cdn links and the js should be in the order..
        // two cdn links and the js file link..

    </script>
